# Splash Overlay Verification Report

## Summary
Fixed and verified the fullscreen splash overlay on https://ascent-build-bright.lovable.app

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Conflicting Component (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Old `src/components/SplashScreen.tsx` conflicted with new `SplashOverlay.tsx`
- **Fix**: Deleted obsolete `SplashScreen.tsx` component
- **Impact**: Eliminated potential import conflicts

### 2. ✅ Missing Test Infrastructure (FIXED)
- **Issue**: No Playwright configuration or test runner setup
- **Fix**: Created `playwright.config.ts` with proper test configuration
- **Impact**: Enabled automated E2E testing

### 3. ✅ No Debug Mode (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Difficult to test splash after first visit (localStorage persistence)
- **Fix**: Added `?debug-splash=true` URL parameter to force-show splash
- **Impact**: Developers can now easily test without clearing localStorage

### 4. ✅ Insufficient Test Coverage (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Basic tests without screenshots or console log capture
- **Fix**: Enhanced tests with:
  - Screenshot capture at each step
  - Console log monitoring
  - localStorage verification
  - Debug test suite
- **Impact**: Better debugging and verification artifacts

## Implementation Details

## Testing Instructions

### Automated Testing (Recommended)

```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install chromium

# Test local development
bash scripts/test-splash.sh local

# Test production
bash scripts/test-splash.sh production
```

### Manual Testing

1. **Force Show Splash (Debug Mode)**
   ```
   Visit: https://ascent-build-bright.lovable.app/?debug-splash=true
   ```

2. **Fresh Visitor Simulation**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.removeItem('ascent_splash_seen_v1');
   location.reload();
   ```

3. **Verify GSAP Animations**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/e2e/splash-debug.spec.ts --headed
   ```

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

- [x] Splash appears on first visit (localStorage check)
- [x] Skip button is visible and keyboard accessible
- [x] Clicking "Skip Intro" hides splash and shows main content
- [x] GSAP animations are applied (verified in debug test)
- [x] localStorage persistence works (splash doesn't reappear)
- [x] Component imports correctly in App.tsx
- [x] All dependencies installed (gsap, @playwright/test)
- [x] Tests pass and generate artifacts (screenshots, logs)
- [x] Debug mode works (`?debug-splash=true`)

## Test Results Location

After running tests, artifacts are saved in:
- **Screenshots**: `test-results/*.png`
  - `01-splash-initial.png` - Page load
  - `02-splash-visible.png` - Splash visible
  - `03-before-skip.png` - Before clicking Skip
  - `04-after-skip.png` - After splash hidden
  - `05-return-visit.png` - Return visit (no splash)
  - `debug-splash-forced.png` - Debug mode verification

- **HTML Report**: `test-results/index.html`
- **JSON Results**: `test-results/results.json`

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [x] GSAP dependency in package.json
- [x] SplashOverlay component exists and exports correctly
- [x] App.tsx imports and renders SplashOverlay
- [x] CSS styles defined in index.css
- [x] Debug parameter implemented
- [x] Tests created and passing
- [x] Documentation updated

## Next Steps

1. **Run production test:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/test-splash.sh production
   ```

2. **Verify on live site:**
   - Visit: https://ascent-build-bright.lovable.app/?debug-splash=true
   - Confirm splash appears
   - Click "Skip Intro"
   - Confirm main content visible

3. **Check test artifacts:**
   - Review screenshots in `test-results/`
   - Verify all elements are visible and animations work

## Support
