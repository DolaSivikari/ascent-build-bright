Understanding the differences can help you make an informed decision.\n\n## Traditional Stucco\n\n### What is it?\nTraditional stucco is a cement-based plaster applied in multiple layers over a wire mesh. It's been used for centuries and is known for durability.\n\n### Pros:\n- **Extremely durable:** Can last 50-80 years with proper maintenance\n- **Fire-resistant:** Non-combustible cement-based material\n- **Low maintenance:** Requires minimal upkeep\n- **Breathable:** Allows moisture to escape\n- **Hard surface:** Resistant to impact damage\n\n### Cons:\n- **Prone to cracking:** Settlement and movement can cause cracks\n- **Limited insulation:** Minimal R-value\n- **Heavy:** Requires strong substrate support\n- **Longer installation:** Multiple layers need drying time\n- **Higher cost:** Labor-intensive installation\n\n## EIFS (Exterior Insulation and Finish System)\n\n### What is it?\nEIFS is a multi-layer exterior wall system featuring insulation board, a base coat with mesh, and a decorative finish coat.\n\n### Pros:\n- **Excellent insulation:** R-values of 4-5.6 per inch\n- **Energy efficient:** Can reduce heating/cooling costs by 20%+\n- **Flexible:** Resists cracking from building movement\n- **Versatile design:** Unlimited textures and colors\n- **Lightweight:** Minimal structural requirements\n- **Faster installation:** Can be completed more quickly\n\n### Cons:\n- **Moisture sensitivity:** Requires proper installation to prevent water intrusion\n- **Impact vulnerability:** Softer surface can dent\n- **Professional installation required:** Must be done correctly\n- **Stigma:** Past moisture issues have created concerns\n\n## Which Should You Choose?\n\n### Choose Traditional Stucco if:\n- You live in a dry climate\n- Impact resistance is a priority\n- You want maximum durability\n- You prefer traditional aesthetics\n- Budget allows for higher initial cost\n\n### Choose EIFS if:\n- Energy efficiency is a top priority\n- You want design flexibility\n- Building movement is a concern\n- Professional installation is guaranteed\n- You're working with a limited budget\n\n## Modern EIFS Solutions\n\nToday's EIFS systems have evolved significantly from early versions. Modern systems include:\n- **Water management features:** Drainage planes and moisture barriers\n- **Impact-resistant options:** Hardened base coats\n- **Warranty programs:** Comprehensive coverage from manufacturers\n\n## Our Recommendation\n\nBoth systems can perform excellently when properly installed.
